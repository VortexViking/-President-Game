**U.S. President Guessing Game**

In this fun and educational game, your goal is to guess the name of a U.S. President based on three clues: the year they were born, their wife's first name, and whether or not they had a beard.

**How to Play:**
1. At the start of the game, the computer randomly selects a U.S. President.
2. You’ll be given three hints:
   - The birth year of the president.
   - The first name of their spouse.
   - Whether or not the president had a beard.
3. You have a maximum of **5 attempts** to guess the president’s name.
   - If you guess correctly on the first attempt, you earn **2 points**.
   - For each correct guess after the first try, you earn **1 point**.
   - For every incorrect guess, you lose **1 point**.
4. After each wrong guess, the game will give you a direction (e.g., "Guess higher!" or "Guess lower!") based on alphabetical order to help you narrow down the possibilities.
5. The game ends when you either guess the president correctly or use all 5 attempts.

**Scoring:**
- **2 points** for guessing correctly on the first try.
- **1 point** for any correct guesses after the first try.
- **-1 point** for each incorrect guess.
- At the end of the game, your total score will be displayed.

**Objective:**  
Guess the president within 5 attempts and achieve the highest score possible!
