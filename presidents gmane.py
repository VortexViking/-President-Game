Here’s an updated version of the U.S. President Guessing Game code where multiple players can play, and each player gets five attempts to guess five different presidents. A scoreboard keeps track of each player’s score.

```python
import random

# List of U.S. Presidents with their birth years, wife's first name, and whether they had a beard
presidents = [
    {"name": "george washington", "birth_year": 1732, "wife": "martha", "has_beard": False},
    {"name": "john adams", "birth_year": 1735, "wife": "abigail", "has_beard": False},
    {"name": "thomas jefferson", "birth_year": 1743, "wife": "martha", "has_beard": False},
    {"name": "james madison", "birth_year": 1751, "wife": "dolley", "has_beard": False},
    {"name": "james monroe", "birth_year": 1758, "wife": "elizabeth", "has_beard": False},
    # ... [rest of the president list here] ...
    {"name": "joe biden", "birth_year": 1942, "wife": "jill", "has_beard": False}
]

def play_round(player_name, chosen_presidents):
    score = 0
    print(f"\n{player_name}, it's your turn!")
    
    for i, chosen_president in enumerate(chosen_presidents):
        print(f"\nGuess #{i+1}")
        print(f"Hint 1: The president was born in {chosen_president['birth_year']}.")
        print(f"Hint 2: The president's wife's first name is {chosen_president['wife']}.")
        print(f"Hint 3: The president {'had' if chosen_president['has_beard'] else 'did not have'} a beard.")
        
        guess = input(f"Attempt {i+1}/5 - Enter your guess: ").strip().lower()

        if guess == chosen_president["name"]:
            score += 1
            print("Correct!")
        else:
            print(f"Wrong! The correct answer was {chosen_president['name']}.")
    
    return score

def guessing_game():
    num_players = int(input("How many players are playing? "))
    player_names = [input(f"Enter player {i+1}'s name: ") for i in range(num_players)]
    
    rounds = 5
    scores = {player: 0 for player in player_names}

    for player in player_names:
        chosen_presidents = random.sample(presidents, rounds)  # Choose 5 random presidents
        scores[player] = play_round(player, chosen_presidents)

    # Display the final scores
    print("\n--- Final Scores ---")
    for player, score in scores.items():
        print(f"{player}: {score} point{'s' if score != 1 else ''}")
    
    # Determine the winner
    winner = max(scores, key=scores.get)
    print(f"\nCongratulations {winner}, you won with {scores[winner]} point{'s' if scores[winner] != 1 else ''}!")

# Start the game
guessing_game()
```
